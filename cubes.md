## Cube Craze Project - MAE 3050

**Project description:** Deisgned, coded, and assembled a autonomous mobile robot for MAE 3780. The robot was designed to compete against other robots in gethering the most cubes on the playing field in 60 seconds. The code in c++ utilized solely registers rather than Arduino commands to control the robot.
