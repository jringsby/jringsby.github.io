## Cube Craze Project - MAE 3780

**Project description:** Deisgned, coded, and assembled an autonomous mobile robot for MAE 3780 - Mechatronics. The robot was designed to compete against other robots in gathering the most cubes on a playing field in 60 seconds. The code in c++ utilized solely registers rather than Arduino commands to control the robot's sensing and actuation.
