## Glider Project - MAE 3050

**Project description:** Designed and fabricated a glider designed to maximixe the time needed to travel 15 meters, relying. on flight perfomance calculations learned in MAE 3050 - Introduction to Aeronautics. Detailed all design processes in a 28 page report. Utilized MATLAB for all supporting calculations, including pitching moment, Reynolds matching to a scale model, and vortex lattice methods.
